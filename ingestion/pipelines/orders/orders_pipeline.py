"""Orders dlt pipeline for the sales-insights product.

Lands the commerce platform's nightly order feed into the domain lakehouse at
``src_orders.orders`` and writes the dlt audit tables (``audit_runs``,
``audit_table_loads``) alongside it. Runs nightly via the platform scheduler;
the eval seeds its output and audit rows directly, so this module is
provenance/reference for the operate scenario, not executed by setup.
